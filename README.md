# PackUnpack

** Please note that this module has been superseded by P5pack on CPAN **

An attempt at implementing Perl 5's pack/unpack functionality
efficiently in Perl 6, if for no other reason we're going to need
it to support "use v5".

# Description
Exports 3 subroutines:
* pack
* unpack
* parse-pack-template

## pack
Provide functionality of Perl 5's pack statement.  Currently supported
directives are: a A c C h H i I l L n N q Q s S U v V x Z

## unpack
Provide functionality of Perl 5's pack statement.  Currently supported
directives are: a A c C h H i I l L n N q Q s S U v V x Z

## parse-pack-template
Parses a given template into an internal format.  If many calls are made
to pack/unpack with the same template, efficiency will improve by parsing
the template only once and feeding its result to pack/unpack instead of
the original template string.

   use PackUnpack;

   say pack("ccxxcc",65,66,67,68); # "AB\0\0CD";

   my @template = parse-pack-template("ccxxcc");
   say pack(@template,65,66,67,68); # same
